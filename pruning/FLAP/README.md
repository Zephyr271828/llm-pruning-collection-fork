# FLAP \& Wanda-sp

This is the official implementation of FLAP & Wanda-sp by An et al, with minimal modifications to make the code compatible with GQA. For the original README, please see [here](ORIGINAL_README.md).

## Installation
```bash
bash scripts/install.sh
```

## Pruning
```bash
# for flap and wanda-sp
bash scripts/prune_llama_7b.sh
bash scripts/prune_llama3.1_8b.sh
```

## Results
Notably, the sequence length of eval data significantly affects the perplexity. Generally, if the sequence length is identical with the model's `max_position_embeddings` (4096 for Llama-2-7B, 8192 for Llama-3.1-8B), the perplexity will be much lower. However, in this section we follow the original setups in the paper and set sequence length to 128.

Notably, the results on Llama-7B are completely identical before and after we patch the codebase to be compatible with GQA, which are both slightly higher than the original paper, but we can rule out the possibility that our patch caused the difference.
